### Basic C Program execution
A C program consists of 
- Preprocessor command and directive (#include)
- Functions, variable, statements of expression and comments    

Compilation of basic C program [more info here](https://www.scaler.com/topics/execution-of-c-program/)
 - Preprocessing (*.i files) 
 - Compilation (*.s files - assembly files)
 - Assembly (*.o files)
 - Linking - static and dynamic linking(*.dll files)  (Linking of all the *.o files to *.exe)

 Command to see the compilation process for C program in GCC.
 ```console 
 gcc -wall -save-temps main.c -o output

 ```

Some other concept of C program are keywords and reserved words. Identifiers are names of functions or variables. Be careful how to declare variable in C as it does not allow special characters such as @, $ etc as identifiers. C programs are case sensitive. Readablity and maintainablity of programs are good things. We can use tools like makefile for large C programs compilations. C program is composed of keywords, identifiers, constants, string literals and symbols.   

### Variable declarations
Different types of variables in C Programming are primary, derived -array,pointer, structure, union etc. and user defined. [more info here](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/data-types-in-c/)

int,char,float, double, long,    
Syntax  

> type variable_name1,name2 = value;   

### Operators in C Programming
Arthmatic +,-./.*.%   
bitwise -  ,   
logical,    
assigment,
